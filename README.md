Overview:
This project analyzes a simulated dataset of loan applications and financial transactions to uncover fraud patterns, assess credit risk, 
and explore customer behavior using advanced SQL queries. The goal was to extract actionable insights useful for fraud detection and loan underwriting strategies.

Objectives:
Understand the relationship between loan decisions and fraudulent activity

Analyze customer transaction behavior by credit score, loan status, and transaction types

Identify high-risk customer segments based on time, amount, and fraud frequency


Analyses Performed:
Loan Data:

Calculated average loan amounts by approval status

Determined monthly loan submission trends

Analyzed rejection rate by employment status and credit score

Transaction Data:

Identified the most common transaction types

Calculated fraud rate per customer and transaction type

Detected peak transaction hours and top spending customers

Cross-Dataset Insights:

Measured fraud rates between approved vs rejected applicants

Compared fraud rates across credit score bands

Calculated the average time gap between loan application and first fraudulent transaction

Tech Stack:
SQL Server / Azure SQL Database

Azure Data Studio and PopSQL for querying and exploration

Data Source: Kaggle Loan & Transaction Fraud Dataset

Impact:

This project demonstrated my ability to:

Join complex datasets using customer IDs

Write analytical SQL queries for fraud detection

Translate raw data into actionable business intelligence
